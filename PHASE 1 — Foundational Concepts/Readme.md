PHASE 1: Foundational Concepts
Phase 1 helps you understand how the internet works underneath and how a user request travels through the network before it reaches a server.

By the end of this phase, you’ll be able to think like a backend engineer and understand how data moves across systems.

🧠 What You Will Learn
✅ 1. Internet & Networking Basics
Topics,You will understand...
CDNs (Content Delivery Networks),Why CDNs reduce global latency by caching content closer to the user.
How DNS works,How DNS finds the correct server by translating a domain name into an IP address.
"IP, TCP, UDP","How packets travel over TCP/UDP, and why TCP is reliable (ordered, guaranteed delivery)."
Latency vs Throughput,What latency means (time for one operation) vs throughput (amount of data/operations per second).
Load Balancers (L4 vs L7),The difference between L4 (Transport Layer) and L7 (Application Layer) load balancers.
