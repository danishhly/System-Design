PHASE 1 — Foundational Concepts
🎯 Goal of Phase 1

Phase 1 helps you understand how the internet works underneath and how a user request travels through the network before it reaches a server.

By the end of this phase, you’ll be able to think like a backend engineer and understand how data moves across systems.

🧠 What You Will Learn
✅ 1. Internet & Networking Basics
Topics:

CDNs

How DNS works

IP, TCP, UDP

Latency vs Throughput

Load Balancers (L4 vs L7)

🎯 You will understand:

How DNS finds the correct server

How packets travel over TCP/UDP

What latency means vs throughput

The difference between L4 & L7 load balancers

Why CDNs reduce global latency

✅ 2. Client–Server Architecture
Topics:

API Gateways

Monolith vs Microservices

Rate Limiting

Synchronous vs Asynchronous Communication

🎯 You will understand:

How client → server requests flow

When to use monolith vs microservices

Why API gateways act as central entry points

Why rate limiting protects servers

When async communication is better for scale

✅ 3. Databases 101
Topics:

Indexing

Joins

Partitioning / Sharding (Intro)

Read Replicas

SQL vs NoSQL

Transactions

🎯 You will understand:

How indexes make queries faster

Why joins work and when they slow down

Basics of sharding & partitioning

Why replicas increase read scalability

Strengths of SQL vs NoSQL

ACID transactions & consistency

📘 How to Study Phase 1
✔️ Step 1 — Networking Basics

DNS → IP/TCP/UDP → Latency → CDN → Load balancers

✔️ Step 2 — Client–Server Architecture

API Gateway → Rate Limiting → Sync vs Async

✔️ Step 3 — Database Fundamentals

Indexes → Joins → Sharding → Replicas → SQL vs NoSQL

📝 Study Tips

Study one file per day

Draw diagrams for DNS, load balancers, API Gateways

Relate every topic to real systems like WhatsApp/Instagram

Keep explanations short but clear

Focus on why things exist, not memorizing

🧑‍🎓 Who Is This Phase For?

Beginners entering system design

Full-stack devs learning backend fundamentals

Anyone preparing for backend interviews

Students who want simple explanations

🎉 Outcome After Phase 1

You will be able to explain:

How DNS works

Why TCP is reliable

Why CDNs reduce latency

Monolith vs microservices

Rate limiting strategies

Sharding vs replicas

SQL vs NoSQL

This foundation prepares you for Phase 2 → Scalability & Architecture.
